Present your case using LegalMatch and in minutes, licensed lawyers in your local area will review it. When a lawyer is interested in taking your case, we provide a full attorney profile that includes their background information, fees, and ratings by other LegalMatch users so you can decide if they're the right lawyer for you. Over three million people and businesses have posted cases on LegalMatch, so why not present your case now?

When you need to find a lawyer, using LegalMatch's no-cost system provides access to pre-screened lawyers through a simple, three-step process. Immediately after you present your case, instant email notifications are sent to lawyers that match the geographic location and legal practice area you specify. You may receive attorney responses via email or phone within the first few hours, but we recommend you wait a day or two to allow the majority of attorneys to review your case. Then it's up to you to select the right lawyer for your case based on the responses you receive and the legal qualifications you're looking for.
